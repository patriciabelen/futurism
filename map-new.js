The translation was undertaken by the Catalan Juan Más y Pi (1878–1916), a literary critic, writer and journalist of anarchist tendencies who spent the major part of his life in Brazil and Argentina. In April 1909, poet Rubén Darío wrote a summary of Futurism in Argentine newspaper La nación in which he criticized Marinetti’s manifesto as vain and fruitless, suitable only for inspiring imitators lacking the talents of its author.",

An important rôle in this respect was played by the journal Poesia  a (semi-)monthly anthology of modern poetry that Marinetti co-founded in 1905.

If translation was the way in which notions of Futurism were introduced to Latin America, it is likely that Darío’s version found the widest distribution across the continent, since he was a well-known and highly recognized author in the whole Spanishspeaking world.
