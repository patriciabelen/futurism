	<h3 class="part">“Typographic Revolution” excerpt and animation</h3>
		<h2 class="about">The founding and launching of Futurism as an artistic and socio-political movement began with a single manifesto first published as a leaflet sent to friends and then on the front page of a Parisian daily newspaper Le Figaro on February 20, 1909. Futurism’s founder, the Italian poet F.T. Marinetti and a collective of painters, writers, architects, photographers would subsequently write over seventy more manifestos on subjects ranging from literature, fashion, theater, advertising and cooking. In the hands of the futurists, the manifestos became a modern-day guerilla marketing and publicity tool to disseminate their theories of modernity. </h2>

  <div class="text textTwo">The <span>book</span> must be the Futurist <span>expression</span> of Futurist thought. Not only that. My revolution is directed against the so-called typographical harmony of the page, which is contrary to the flux and reflux, the leaps and bursts of style that run through the page itself. For that reason we will use, in the very same page, three or four different <span>colors</span> of ink, and as many as twenty different typographical <span>fonts</span> if necessary. For example: italics for a series of swift or similar sensations, boldface for violent onomatopoeias, etc. The typographical revolution and the multicolored variety in the letters will mean that I can double the expressive force of words.

<div class="text textThree">I oppose the decorative and precious aesthetic of Mallarmé and his search for the exotic word, the unique and irreplaceable, elegant, suggestive, exquisite adjective. I have no wish to suggest an idea of sensation by means of passéist graces and affectations: I want to seize them brutally and fling them in the reader’s face. I also oppose Mallarmé’s static ideal.</div>
